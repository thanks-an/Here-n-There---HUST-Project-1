Hi! 
This is Here! and There!, an application that help you manage your favorite list of locations and share them with your friend.

The application has the following functions:
- Register a new account
- Log in to your account to use
- Allows users to save favorite locations. Suggested categories: Food stores, Coffee shops, Movie theaters, Fashion stores...
- Synchronize the directory with the server
- Allows users to share locations with friends: Users tag friends' names in the location to share. Every time a user logs in, the server sends a notification of a new location shared by friends for the user to save in their personal directory.
- Note, when displaying categories, there needs to be a sign to distinguish which locations are shared by friends.
